    ABSTRACT="This paper presents a new dataset for sentiment analysis in Brazilian Portuguese. These texts were extracted from a Brazilian social network called Meu Querido Diário. In this social network, users often share feelings and emotions associated with everyday life. The main difference of this data set is that, in this social network, the user himself can inform the emotion associated with his entry. Preliminary experiments were performed with some classification models, creating the first baseline results. The model that obtained the best result was the SVM with linear kernel using bigrams.",
